# What is this project"?

</h4>

This project presents a directed weighted graph written using the language *Python*  ,you can take advantage of main functions like *short_path* in order to find the shortest path,
*plot_graph* to visually see the graph and connected_components,connected_component to finds all the Strongly Connected Component(SCC) in the graph.

Dijkstra's algorithm-is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. It was conceived by computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956 and published three years later.[5][6][7]

The algorithm exists in many variants. Dijkstra's original algorithm found the shortest path between two given nodes,[7] but a more common variant fixes a single node as the "source" node and finds shortest paths from the source to all other nodes in the graph, producing a shortest-path tree.
