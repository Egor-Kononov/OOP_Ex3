# What is this project"?

</h4>

This project presents a directed weighted graph written using the language *Python*  ,you can take advantage of main functions like *short_path* in order to find the shortest path,
*plot_graph* to visually see the graph and connected_components,connected_component to finds all the Strongly Connected Component(SCC) in the graph.
